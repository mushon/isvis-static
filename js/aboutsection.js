They look complete, true, whole, certain, scientific, neutral… in particular for people who don't make them.”**\n\n> —<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdRilsNmXX0\" target=\"_blank\">Catherine D’Ignazio at ISVIS 2017</a>\n\nAs more and more data is being gathered and as data-driven algorithmic analysis moves more and more decision making power behind the scenes, data visualization emerges as a crucial interface between humans and machines. Dataviz manifests again through two conflicting trends, on one hand the popularization of science and click-bait infographics, and on the other hand the age of post-truth, science-denialism, fake news and deep-fakes. In light of these pressing issues we want to examine once more the practical, critical and creative aspects of visualization in industry, academia, journalism, politics and civic discourse.\n\nOn the 12th of May, 2019, we will meet for the fifth time at ISVIS, the Israeli Visualization conference, to explore the local and international developments in dataviz. In past years ISVIS hosted the leading visualization researchers and practiotioners including Moritz Stefaner, Catherine D'Ignazio, Barbara Tversky, Robert Kosara, Enrico Bertini and others... This year, we will continue ISVIS’s interdisciplinary tradition and host a wide variety of researchers and practitioners from Israel and abroad for a discussion on the crossroads between design, engineering, communication, cognitive psychology, academy and industry. The conference will take place this year again at Shenkar college at Ramat-Gan.\n\n<!--\n### Open call\n\nIn addition to invited keynote lectures, we will be glad to widen our scope and invite the local community to participate in the conference as speakers.\n\nProposals can be of three formats:\n- Lightning talk - a quick description of a project, a case study or one simple topic (up to 8 minutes) \n- Presentation (Up to 18 minutes) \n- Panel - up to 4 panelists + 1 moderator (Up to 60-90 minutes)\n\nTopics can be from, but are not limited to:\n- Cognitive research in visualization \n- Engineering aspects of visualization \n- Visualization and digital humanities \n- Data Journalism \n- Contemporary Mapping\n- New trends in information design \n- Questions of ethics and responsibility in visualization \n- Visualization and User Experience\n- Visualization literacy\n- Visualizing Uncertainty \n- Visualizing Algorithms\n- Visualization and Big Data\n- Visualization and BioInformatics\n- Info-activism and visualization \n- Case studies from industry and academia\n- Teaching visualization\n- Between visualization and simulation\n- Visualization and Deep Learning\n- Data art\n- Dashboard design\n- Micro-visualization\n- Evaluation of visualization \n-->\n\n### Important dates: \n\n**Jan 28th, 2019** - Open call starts\n\n**Mar 9th, 2019** - Open call ends (extended from Feb 28th)\n\n**March 31st, 2019** - Answers sent for the calls\n\n**April 30th, 2019** - Early Bird tickets deadline\n\n**May 12th, 2019** - ISVIS Conference Day\n\n<!--\nWe hope to <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrSJjPteTRcY1vqZ\" target=\"_blank\">hear from you soon</a>,\n-->\n\n\nMeira Levy (Shenkar),\n\nMushon Zer-Aviv (Shenkar).\n\n<!--\n<style>\nbody.style-intro {\nbackground: #52e78c;\n}\n</style>\n-->","createdAt":{"$date":"2018-12-08T08:02:30.411Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2020-03-05T15:11:20.653Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5c0b7a96acafc5499bd4bdad"},
